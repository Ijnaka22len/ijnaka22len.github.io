            <h3>July 2025: The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems</h3>
            <p>
                AI is moving beyond single models to collaborative, multi-agent systems. Tools like CrewAI and LangGraph
                are enabling the coordination of multiple specialized agents to perform complex workflows — from writing
                research papers to automating full-stack development.

            <h3>June 2025: Open-Source LLMs Surging</h3>
            <p>
                Open-source large language models (LLMs) like Mistral, LLaMA 3, and Falcon are becoming viable alternatives
                to closed models. HuggingFace is now home to thousands of finetuned models, and companies are increasingly
                adopting open models to cut costs and ensure control.

            <h3>May 2025: AI + Edge Devices</h3>
            <p>
                Edge AI is gaining traction with chips like NVIDIA Jetson, Google's Coral, and TinyML platforms enabling
                real-time inference on-device. This means faster processing, improved privacy, and reduced cloud dependency —
                especially for healthcare and IoT applications.
